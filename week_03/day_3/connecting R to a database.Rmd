- connect R to a postgres database (omni pool)

## Don't put login credintials on github (or any public place)

- be careful with how we work with out login details

-- host name
-- username
-- database
-- port
-- password

2 main strategies

 - gitignore
 -store outside of a git repo
 
 Load in our secret login credential into R
 
```{r}
source("secrets.R")
```
